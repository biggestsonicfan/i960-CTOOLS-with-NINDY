/* Recognizing signal handler frames.  */

/* GNU/Linux has two flavors of signals.  Normal signal handlers, and
   "realtime" (RT) signals.  The RT signals can provide additional
   information to the signal handler if the SA_SIGINFO flag is set
   when establishing a signal handler using `sigaction'.  It is not
   unlikely that future versions of GNU/Linux will support SA_SIGINFO
   for normal signals too.  */

/* When the i386 Linux kernel calls a signal handler and the
   SA_RESTORER flag isn't set, the return address points to a bit of
   code on the stack.  This function returns whether the PC appears to
   be within this bit of code.

   The instruction sequence for normal signals is
       pop    %eax
       mov    $0x77,%eax
       int    $0x80
   or 0x58 0xb8 0x77 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xcd 0x80.

   Checking for the code sequence should be somewhat reliable, because
   the effect is to call the system call sigreturn.  This is unlikely
   to occur anywhere other than a signal trampoline.

   It kind of sucks that we have to read memory from the process in
   order to identify a signal trampoline, but there doesn't seem to be
   any other way.  The PC_IN_SIGTRAMP macro in tm-linux.h arranges to
   only call us if no function name could be identified, which should
   be the case since the code is on the stack.

   Detection of signal trampolines for handlers that set the
   SA_RESTORER flag is in general not possible.  Unfortunately this is
   what the GNU C Library has been doing for quite some time now.
   However, as of version 2.1.2, the GNU C Library uses signal
   trampolines (named __restore and __restore_rt) that are identical
   to the ones used by the kernel.  Therefore, these trampolines are
   supported too.  */
